Countdown is a WordPress plugin that displays a countdown timer.
Javascript is written by Robert Hashemian. The WordPress code is mine.

Usage:

Place the code above inside your WordPress post or page.
[countdown event="Sunday 10:00am"]

For templates, use this code:
echo do_shortcode('[countdown event="Saturday 11am"]');
